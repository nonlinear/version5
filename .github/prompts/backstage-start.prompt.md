# backstage Start (Project Status Check)

> **Universal pre-commit workflow for AI-assisted development.** Ensures documentation matches reality before every push.

**Purpose:** Validate stability, sync docs, determine next steps.

**When to use:** Before EVERY commit, especially after long breaks or major changes.

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE:** Never push until ALL checks pass. Return to fix or ask for clarification.

**How it works:** Read README's 🤖 navigation block → Run checks → Update docs → Commit

---

### Possible Outcomes

```mermaid

    STEP4([user asks /whatsup]) --> CHECK{Checks passed?}

    CHECK -->|No| REPORT1[🛑 Failed Checks]
    REPORT1 -->|Fixes applied<br/>Checks pass| STABLE

    CHECK -->|Yes| STABLE{Docs match reality?}

    STABLE -->|No| REPORT2[⚠️ Docs Mismatch]
    REPORT2 -->|Docs updated| PROGRESS

    STABLE -->|Yes| PROGRESS{Work done?}

    PROGRESS -->|No changes| GROOM
    PROGRESS -->|Partial| REPORT4[✅ In Progress]
    PROGRESS -->|Complete| REPORT5[🎉 Version Complete]

    REPORT4 --> GROOM
    REPORT5 --> GROOM

    GROOM[📋 List next options<br/>Report: what, when, next]

    GROOM --> NEXT_VERSION([Start new version])
    GROOM --> ROADMAP_GROOM([Groom roadmap])
```

---

**What this means:**

1. **Read README** to find where status files live (always project-specific)
2. **Compare** actual work with documented plans
3. **Validate** stability using HEALTH (check [README](/README.md) for location)
4. **Update** docs automatically (ROADMAP → CHANGELOG)
5. **Determine outcome** (1 of 5 possible states)
6. **Act** (push, fix, or groom)

---

## 📋 STEP 0: Find Status Files in README

**🤖 CRITICAL: README's navigation block is the ONLY source of truth**

**README's `> 🤖` block:**

- ✅ **Source of truth** — Canonical list of all status file paths
- ✅ **Must be distributed** — Copy to ALL status files (with adjusted relative paths)
- ✅ **Read paths first** — Use these paths for all file operations

### What to Look For

**Every README.md must contain a navigation block starting and ending with `> 🤖`:**

```markdown
> 🤖
>
> - [README](./README.md) - Our project
> - [CHANGELOG](path/to/CHANGELOG.md) — What we did
> - [ROADMAP](path/to/ROADMAP.md) — What we wanna do
> - [POLICY](path/to/POLICY.md) — How we do it
> - [CHECKS](path/to/HEALTH.md) — What we accept
> - [/backstage-start](path/to/backstage-start.prompt.md) — The prompt that keeps us sane
>
> 🤖
```

**This block contains ALL status file paths. Always read it first.**

---

### How to Extract Paths

```bash
# Step 1: Read README.md
cat README.md

# Step 2: Look for lines between > 🤖 markers
# Extract all paths from markdown links
# Example: > - [CHANGELOG](./backstage/CHANGELOG.md) — What we did
#          └─ Path is: ./backstage/CHANGELOG.md
```

### Polycentric Governance: Global + Project

**backstage uses overlapping jurisdictions - check BOTH levels:**

1. **Global defaults** (`backstage/global/`) - Universal rules from backstage framework
2. **Project overrides** (`backstage/`) - Project-specific rules that take precedence

**For HEALTH.md:**

- Read `backstage/global/HEALTH.md` first (universal validation)
- Then read `backstage/HEALTH.md` (project-specific checks)
- Run ALL checks from both files
- If conflict, project check wins

**For POLICY.md:**

- Read `backstage/global/POLICY.md` first (workflow defaults)
- Then read `backstage/POLICY.md` (project rules)
- Project rules extend/override global rules
- When documenting: cite which level (e.g., "per project POLICY" or "per global POLICY")

### Critical Rules for Navigation Block

**🚨 AI: NEVER proceed without finding the 🤖 block first**

✅ **DO:**

- Read README.md completely
- Find the `> 🤖` ... `> 🤖` section
- Extract all file paths from markdown links
- Use ONLY these paths for all operations
- Copy this navigation block to ALL status files (with adjusted relative paths)

❌ **DON'T:**

- Edit README without explicit permission
- Create custom navigation - always copy from README
- Assume file locations (even common ones like `/docs/`)
- Hardcode paths anywhere

### Status Files are AI Prompts

**Each status file is an instruction set for AI:**

- **HEALTH.md** → Executable tests/validation (treat as test suite)
- **POLICY.md** → Workflow rules and conventions (treat as process spec)
- **ROADMAP.md** → Planned features with epic format (treat as backlog)
- **CHANGELOG.md** → Version history (treat as append-only log)

**AI workflow:**

1. Read README → Extract 🤖 paths
2. **Read status files as prompts** → Follow their instructions
3. Execute CHECKS → Validate stability
4. Follow POLICY → Apply workflow rules
5. Update ROADMAP/CHANGELOG → Sync docs with reality

---

**If README doesn't have `> 🤖` navigation block:**

1. ❌ **STOP:** Ask user "Where are your status files? (e.g., /docs/, /engine/docs/, root)"
2. ✅ Create navigation block in README first
3. ✅ Then proceed with whatsup workflow

**Example extraction:**

```markdown
From README:

> - [CHANGELOG](./backstage/CHANGELOG.md) — What we did

Extracted path:
./backstage/CHANGELOG.md

Use for:
cat ./backstage/CHANGELOG.md
```

### Distributing the 🤖 Block + Mermaid Roadmap

**🚨 WHEN TO UPDATE: Every time you groom ROADMAP (add/complete/move epics) in HEALTH.md**

**Process:**

1. Update mermaid diagram in ROADMAP.md (source of truth)
2. Copy updated diagram to README.md (at END, after 🤖 block)
3. Copy 🤖 block + mermaid to ALL other status files (at TOP, after title)

**🚨 CRITICAL: The mermaid roadmap diagram must be duplicated in ALL status files**

**Placement rules:**

- **README.md:** 🤖 block + mermaid at END (before final close)
- **All others (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, POLICY, CHECKS):** 🤖 block + mermaid at TOP (right after # Title)

**After reading README's 🤖 block, copy it + mermaid to ALL status files:**

````markdown
# In README.md (source of truth):

# ... content ...

> 🤖
>
> - [CHANGELOG](./backstage/CHANGELOG.md) — What we did
> - [ROADMAP](./backstage/ROADMAP.md) — What we wanna do
> - etc...
>
> 🤖

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize':'14px'}}}%%
graph LR
    ... (roadmap diagram from ROADMAP.md)
```

# In backstage/CHANGELOG.md (at TOP after title):

# Librarian MCP - Changelog

> 🤖
>
> - [README](../../README.md) - Our project
> - [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) — What we did ← adjusted paths
> - [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) — What we wanna do
> - etc...
>
> 🤖

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize':'14px'}}}%%

    ... (SAME roadmap diagram)
```

## v1.0.0

# In backstage/ROADMAP.md (at TOP after title):

> - [README](../../README.md) - Our project ← adjusted paths
> - etc...
>
> 🤖

```mermaid
... (source diagram)
```

## v0.5.1

... content ...
````

**Path adjustment rules:**

- Same directory → Use filename only: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Parent directory → Use `../path` or `../../path`
- Child directory → Use `subdir/file.md`
- Keep description text identical across all files
- **Always copy the EXACT same mermaid diagram from ROADMAP.md**
- **README keeps mermaid at END, all others at TOP**

---

## Workflow Start

### Branch Detection (Run First)

**Get current branch:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Decision tree:**

**A. On epic branch (e.g., `v0.4.0`)**
→ **Status Update Mode** (skip epic selection)

```
🔍 You're on: v0.4.0

Reading epic notes from ROADMAP.md...
```

**Show:**

- ✅ What's done (from session notes)
- ⏳ What's left (unchecked tasks)
- 🚫 Blockers (if any)
- 📊 Quick stats (files changed, hours worked)

**Then ask:**

```
Continue working? Or:
1. Run CHECKS and commit
2. /backstage-end (pause session)
3. Switch to different epic
```

**B. On main branch**
→ **Normal Flow** (choose epic or groom)

```
🌟 You're on: main

Options:
1. Choose epic to work on
2. Groom ROADMAP
3. Create new epic
```

---

## 📊 STEP 1: Compare Work vs Documentation

**AI: What actually changed vs what's documented?**

---

> Note: This prompt orchestrates the workflow defined in the status files (POLICY.md, ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, HEALTH.md). All workflow rules and epic/branch conventions live in POLICY.md. If you see redundant or outdated workflow details here, update or remove them in favor of the status files as the single source of truth.

### 1A. Analyze Actual Changes

```bash
# What files changed?
git diff --name-status

# What code changed?
git diff --stat

# What commits since last release?
LAST_VERSION=$(grep -m1 "^## v" CHANGELOG.md | cut -d' ' -f2)
git log --oneline "${LAST_VERSION}..HEAD" || git log --oneline -5
```

**Categorize changes:**

- [ ] Bug fixes only → Patch version (v0.2.0 → v0.2.1)
- [ ] New features, backward compatible → Minor version (v0.2.x → v0.3.0)
- [ ] Breaking changes → Major version (v0.x → v1.0)

### 1B. Check ROADMAP

**AI: Read ROADMAP (check [README](/README.md) for location) and find matching features:**

```bash
# For Personal Library:
cat backstage/ROADMAP.md | grep "🔶 (IN PROGRESS)\|❌ (PLANNED)" -A 20

# Generic:
cat ROADMAP.md | grep -Ei "in progress|planned|todo" -A 20
```

**Questions to answer:**

- [ ] Did we complete a ROADMAP feature?
- [ ] Did we work on something NOT in ROADMAP? (document it)
- [ ] Are ROADMAP checkboxes accurate? (update them)

### 1C. Match Reality to Plans

**AI: Create comparison report:**

```markdown
## Work vs Documentation Analysis

**What I found in git:**

- Changed files: [list]
- Type of change: [patch/minor/major]
- Estimated scope: [1 feature / multiple / refactor]

**What ROADMAP says:**

- Listed as: [version section, e.g., "v0.3: Delta Indexing"]
- Status: [IN PROGRESS / PLANNED / not mentioned]
- Checkboxes: [X done / Y pending]

**Match?**

- ✅ YES: ROADMAP accurately reflects what we did
- ❌ NO: Need to update [ROADMAP/CHANGELOG]
  - Action: [move to CHANGELOG / update checkboxes / add new section]
```

---

## 🧪 STEP 2: Run Stability Checks (MANDATORY)

**🚨 CRITICAL:** Do NOT proceed to STEP 3 unless ALL checks pass.

### 2A. Read HEALTH (Polycentric: Global + Project)

**AI: Read BOTH global and project HEALTH files (polycentric governance):**

```bash
# 1. Read universal checks from global framework
cat [STATUS_FILES_LOCATION]/global/HEALTH.md

# 2. Read project-specific checks
cat [STATUS_FILES_LOCATION]/HEALTH.md

# Both files contain checks to run
# If same check exists in both, project version wins
```

**If global/HEALTH.md doesn't exist:**

- This is fine - not all projects use backstage framework
- Skip to project HEALTH.md only

**If project HEALTH.md doesn't exist:**

- ❌ **STOP:** "I don't see HEALTH.md. What tests must pass before pushing?"
- ✅ Create HEALTH.md from user input (use template from templates/)

### 2B. Execute Tests from HEALTH (Run ALL from Both Files)

**Run checks from BOTH files in order:**

1. **Global checks first** (universal framework validation)
   - Look for bash script blocks in global/HEALTH.md
   - Execute each test
   - Track results

2. **Project checks second** (project-specific validation)
   - Look for bash script blocks in HEALTH.md
   - Execute each test
   - Track results

3. **Merge results:**
   - If same test name appears in both → use project result (project wins)
   - Otherwise combine all unique tests

**Example output:**

```
🔍 Running stability checks...

📂 Global checks (from global/HEALTH.md):
1️⃣ Navigation block exists...
✅ Pass

2️⃣ File structure valid...
✅ Pass

🎯 Project checks (from HEALTH.md):
3️⃣ Server startup test...
✅ Pass

4️⃣ Dependencies installed...
✅ Pass

✅ All checks complete (2 global + 2 project = 4 total)
```

**Note:** CHECKS location specified in [README](/README.md)

### 2C. Validation Gate

**AI: Report results in table:**

```markdown
## Stability Check Results

| Test     | Status | Output         |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- |
| [Test 1] | ✅/❌  | [brief result] |
| [Test 2] | ✅/❌  | [brief result] |

**Overall:** [✅ ALL PASS / ❌ X FAILURES]

**Current branch:** [branch name from git branch --show-current]
```

**Decision tree:**

- ✅ **All pass:** Proceed to STEP 3
- ❌ **Any fail:**

  ```
  🛑 STOP: Cannot push until checks pass.

  Failed: [test names]

  Options:
  1. Fix the issue and re-run checks
  2. Ask me to clarify the requirement
  3. Document as known issue (add to ROADMAP)

  What would you like to do?
  ```

---

## ✏️ STEP 3: Update Documentation

**AI: Automatically update status files based on STEP 1 analysis**

### 3A. Update ROADMAP

**Location:** Check [README](/README.md) for status files location.

**Epic Format:**

> 🤖 **CRITICAL:** Always read epic format from global/POLICY.md#epic-format
> User may customize syntax - NEVER use hardcoded format

**To write epics correctly:**

1. Read global/POLICY.md section "Epic Format" (check [README](/README.md) for location)
2. Find the `**AI Note:** Use this syntax when writing epics` marker
3. Use that exact syntax for all epic writes
4. Respect status indicators defined in POLICY.md:
   - 🚧 with link = active branch exists
   - ⏳ no link = planned, no branch yet
   - ✅ completed (changelog only)

**If feature completed:**

```markdown
# Read current epic format from global/POLICY.md

# Mark checkbox as [x] in ROADMAP

# If all checkboxes done, move entire epic to CHANGELOG
```

**If version fully complete:**

- Move entire section from ROADMAP to CHANGELOG (check [README](/README.md) for locations)
- Update status indicator per global/POLICY.md rules
- Add completion date

**🤖 CRITICAL: Add Navigation Menu to ALL Status Files**

Every status file (ROADMAP, CHANGELOG, CHECKS) must end with this navigation menu:

```markdown
---

> 🤖: See [ROADMAP](path/to/ROADMAP.md) for planned features & in-progress work
> 🤖: See [CHANGELOG](path/to/CHANGELOG.md) for version history & completed features
> 🤖: See [CHECKS](path/to/HEALTH.md) for stability requirements & testing
> 👷: Consider using [/backstage-start prompt](https://github.com/nonlinear/nonlinear.github.io/blob/main/.github/prompts/backstage-start.prompt.md) for updates
```

**Important:** Adjust paths relative to each file's location:

- If file is in `/backstage/ROADMAP.md`, links are: `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HEALTH.md`, `../.github/prompts/backstage-start.prompt.md`
- If file is in `/docs/ROADMAP.md`, links are: `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HEALTH.md`, `../.github/prompts/backstage-start.prompt.md`
- If file is in root `/ROADMAP.md`, links are: `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HEALTH.md`, `.github/prompts/backstage-start.prompt.md`

**When to add menu:**

- When creating new status files
- When updating existing status files (if menu is missing or outdated)
- Place menu AFTER all content, before "Last updated" timestamp (if exists)

### 3B. Update CHANGELOG

**Location:** Check [README](/README.md) for status files location.

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE: CHANGELOG is append-only**

- ✅ **ADD new entries at the top** (newest first)
- ❌ **NEVER edit old entries** (history is immutable)
- ✅ **If mistake in old entry:** Add clarification/correction as NEW entry
- 📝 **Rename/refactor?** Document in NEW entry, keep old names in history

**Why:** CHANGELOG is historical record of what actually happened at that time. If old entry says "query_partitioned.py", that's what existed then. Don't rewrite history.

**Example - The RIGHT way:**

```markdown
## v0.5.0 - 2026-01-20 (NEW ENTRY - documents rename)

### Renamed for Clarity

- Scripts: query_partitioned.py → research.py (matches research.prompt.md)
  ...

## v0.3.0 - 2026-01-19 (OLD ENTRY - left unchanged)

- Added: query_partitioned.py for CLI queries
```

**AI: Add new entry following project format:**

```markdown
# Read CHANGELOG format from existing entries or global/POLICY.md

# Follow the established pattern for version headers and content

# Add new entry at TOP (newest first)

# Include completion date, who benefits, what's new, impact
```

### 3C. Version Bumping

**AI: Determine next version:**

```bash
# Get current version from CHANGELOG
CURRENT=$(grep -m1 "^## v" CHANGELOG.md | sed 's/^## v//' | cut -d':' -f1 | tr -d ' ')

# Based on STEP 1 categorization:
# Patch: v0.2.0 → v0.2.1
# Minor: v0.2.1 → v0.3.0
# Major: v0.9.0 → v1.0.0
```

**Update version references:**

- [ ] CHANGELOG (add new entry at top) - check [README](/README.md) for location
- [ ] package.json / setup.py / Cargo.toml (if exists)
- [ ] README.md (if version mentioned)

---

## 👤 STEP 4: Developer Context Summary

**AI: Generate outcome-based summary for the developer**

---

### 🛑 Failed Checks

**When:** STEP 2 checks failed

**AI reports:**

```markdown
## 🛑 CANNOT PUSH - Checks Failed

**Failed tests:**

1. [Test name] - [Error message]
2. [Test name] - [Error message]

**Problem:**
[Explain what's wrong in plain language]

**Suggested fixes:**

1. [Specific action to take]
2. [Alternative approach]

**Options:**

- Fix the issue and re-run /backstage-start
- Ask me to clarify the requirement
- Document as known issue in ROADMAP

What would you like to do?
```

**After fixes → Re-run /backstage-start → Continues to stable state**

---

- Fix the issue and re-run whatsup
- Ask me to clarify the requirement
- Document as known issue in ROADMAP

What would you like to do?

---

## 📖 Templates for New Projects

**If README doesn't specify status files location, create them:**

### Ask User for Location

```
I don't see status files listed in README.md.

Where should I create them?
1. Root directory (/, simpler)
2. /docs/ (organized)
3. /engine/docs/ (complex projects)
4. Other location?
```

### Template Structure

All status files should include navigation menu pointing to actual location:

```markdown
**📋 Project Status Files:**
**Location:** [actual location - e.g., /docs/]

- README - Entry point (check README for links)
- ROADMAP - Planned features (check README for links)
- CHANGELOG - Version history (check README for links)
- CHECKS - Stability tests (check README for links)
```

**No hardcoded paths in backstage-start.prompt.md** - README is the only source of truth for all file locations.

## 🎯 The 3-Level System

This prompt is **Level 3** - the most abstract layer:

### Level 1: Personal (Not tracked)

- Your own books indexed
- Your personal notes
- Your local configuration
- **Not part of any project**

### Level 2: Project-Specific (Personal Library MCP)

- Generic tool others can use
- Users add their own books
- AI retrieval via `/research` prompt
- **Example flagship project for Level 3**

### Level 3: Meta-Workflow (backstage-start.prompt.md)

- **This file** - works for ANY project
- Uses Personal Library as working example
- No hardcoded paths or project detection
- Reads README to find everything
- **Can be copied to any project**

**The Hierarchy:**

```
backstage-start.prompt.md (agnostic workflow)
  ↓ Uses as example ↓
Personal Library MCP (project with status files)
  ↓ User-specific ↓
Your books (not tracked, personal)
```

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**The Model:**

1. **README** → ONLY source of truth for file locations
2. **backstage-start.prompt.md** → Reads README, stays agnostic, works everywhere
3. **Status Files** → Project-specific (tests, versioning, features)

**Flow:**

```
AI needs to commit
  ↓
Read README (where are status files?)
  ↓ If not found → ask user, create them
Read status files (what are the specifics?)
  ↓
Run workflow (5 steps → 5 outcomes)
  ↓
✅ Push or 🛑 Fix or 🧑 Groom
```

## Key Principles

1. **🤖 Navigation block in README = Single source of truth** — Must be distributed to all status files
2. **Status files = AI prompts** — CHECKS and POLICY contain executable instructions
3. **Read paths from 🤖 block** → Never assume file locations
4. **5 possible outcomes** → Each triggers different actions
5. **Checks must pass** before any commit
6. **Documentation auto-syncs** with reality
7. **Works on ANY project** → No hardcoded paths
